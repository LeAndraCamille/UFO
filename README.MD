    The purpose of this analysis is to look at how Javascript applies to data analytics and visualization. This particular project she wanted to go back in the 1950s for the famous UFO sightings in Oregon. Moving forward we then use Javascript to create a webpage using the data file for the story line and avalible data. HTML page will then be created with data from Javascript.

Summary:
    This analysis is an amazing starter place. There are some suggestions you can do to improve you webpage and make it more appealing. 
1) Being limited to searching the data in one Javascript file may put a cap on the link webpage and others that may have the same goal. In order to avoid that I recomment web scrapping. Web scrapping is just gives you more opportunites to share and update as often as you need. 

2) You can not add personal UFO sightings to the webpage. Another suggestion would me creating maybe a comment section or just an area separte from the data website to allow others share their experience with UFO sightings.
